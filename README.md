**Validation_Methods_Validation** compares the accuracy of KS test and bootstrapping Sharpe by simulating market alpha series over time. All simulated alpha series follow the same distribution and hence both tests should be able to pick number of inconsistent tests according to significant levels.

In conclusion, KS is more accurate in this test and bootstrapping Sharpe seems to have higher type 1 error than expected.



**validation_example** provides a process to validate performance series with the consideration of potential overfitting risk.
